Today I finally got some stuff working.

- The domain *eeknay.net* registered
- rented vserver @ [greatnet](http://www.greatnet.de/ "Greatnet")
- Dug into static page generator such as [hyde](http://hyde.github.com/ "hyde") and [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "jekyll") - went with jekyll

My sever is currently running on CentOS and using lighttpd :)
